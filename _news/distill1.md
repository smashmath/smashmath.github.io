you may have noticed the way some of my posts look is different now. im in the process of moving to the distill theme. idk how long itll take to do them all but im probably going to do my favorite posts first. im also most likely going to revise each post that i update so its probably going to take a lot longer than it needs to. so yeah thats it i guess. have a good day.

current posts which have been revised / updated:
1. [Solving systems of first-order ODEs like a baller](/math/firstordersystemsquick){:target="_blank"} (12/05/21)
2. [Shortcuts for Finding Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors](/math/eigentricks){:target="_blank"} (12/05/21)
3. [Exact Equations Done Quick](/math/exacteqs){:target="_blank"} (12/06/21)
4. [The Alpha Method (Generalized Exponential Response Formula)](/math/alphamethod){:target="_blank"} (12/06/21)
5. [Tricks for Remembering Laplace Transforms](/math/laplacetricks){:target="_blank"} (12/06/21)
6. [Constructing Systems of Nonlinear First-Order Differential Equations to Model Population Dynamics](/math/nonlinearbuild){:target="_blank"} (12/07/21)
7. [Matrix Exponential Formulas for 2x2 Matrices](/math/2x2ezmatrixexp){:target="_blank"}. mostly rewritten. old version [here](/math/ezmatrixexp){:target="_blank"}. (12/08/21)
