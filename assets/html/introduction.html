    <h1>Please Introduce Yourself!</h1>
    <p>Hello, everyone! My name is Taylor, and I am going to be your TA this upcoming quarter for MATH011/CS011.</p>
    <p>I hope your winter break is going well so far! I know we've still got a few days before the class starts officially, but I would greatly appreciate it if you could introduce yourself in this discussion thread. It's certainly optional, but I would really enjoy getting to know you all a bit (and it helps me remember your names). I would like to know:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>The name you prefer to go by (if you would like to include pronounciation that would be very helpful!)</li>
        <li>Your year and major</li>
        <li>Programming experience (if you have any) including languages and the math classes you have taken here at UCR</li>
        <li>Any hobbies you would feel comfortable sharing</li>
        <li>Optional: Anything you'd like to share (Some ideas: something fun you did over the break, a favorite music artist/album/movie, an appropriate meme, a funny story, etc.).</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        I'll start! I go by Taylor (or TAylor), and I am a second-year Math PhD student, and I majored in mathematics during my undergrad. I like to play music and have been teaching myself guitar and python. Last year I used linear algebra to write a python program to detect the page color of my pdfs after a professor broke the department copier trying to print my homework.
