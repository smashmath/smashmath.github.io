    <h1>Welcome to MATH011/CS011!</h1>
    <p>Hello, everyone! My name is Taylor, and I am going to be your TA this upcoming quarter for MATH011/CS011.</p>

        Note: I am a TA for four sections of this class (with two different professors): Two sections for one professor on Tuesday and two for a different professor on Wednesday. Please include the course number (MATH011) and either your section number or the day/time of your discussion in the subject of your email. This really helps me keep track of everything! If you don't, then I might have to search through all four sections to find you in Canvas. Ex.

    <h2>Discord</h2>
    <p>
        <a href="https://discord.gg/ZGMwhMCwHT"><strong>Discord server invite</strong></a>. Technically optional, but it serves as a sort of hub for the class. You can ask questions, get help, and chat with your classmates here. Further, I will be posting minor announcements here, so it is a good idea to join.
